# Vietnamese-Handwriting-Recognition
This is my prethesis project where i use what i learnt to make a model that can take Vietnamese handwritten as an image input and try to read them
using CRNN(CNN + RNN) model implemented by Tensorflow 
# To Do List:
* Clean data
* Read image using openCV
* Preprocess images (resize, grayscale, blur, threshold)
* Split dataset into trainset and testset
* Build CRNN model with CTC loss
* Evaluate
* Calculate metrics for SER, WER and CER
# Data
Data used in this project is provided by Cinnamon AI. It can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ULMGkXxPRadFOqUs1-7BUiZv-_QNpGx/view?usp=sharing)

The dataset have 1838 images and their label are stored in a json file.

Here is the first look of the raw data

The tradition method of OCR is using CNN where we crop each letter and use them to train our model, however this method have many flaws:
* It cannot predict long sequence text
* Time consuming
* Expensive

In this project, I use the CRNN model which is the combination of CNN, RNN and CTC loss for image-based sequence regconition goal which is perfect in this scenario.
By using CRNN instead of normal CNN, we can shorten the time needed for training and also increase accuracy.
The image will be sliced base on the time step that we define in the RNN step and will be decoded later on using CTC loss function


# Result

By analyzing the loss, i can calculate the most 3 import metrics for text-based regconition task
* CER (Character error rate): 
* WER (Word error rate):
* SER (Sequence error rate):
